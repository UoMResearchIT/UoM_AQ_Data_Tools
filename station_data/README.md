# Station Metadata

Two station metadata files are included:
- `station_data_clean.csv`: this is for the MEDMI stations.
- `AURN_metadata.RData`: this is for the AURN stations.

Both contain latitude and longitude information for the stations.
These files were obtained/created in 2020. If there have been 
stations added to the networks since then, they will not be included
in these files.
